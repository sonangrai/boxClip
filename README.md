## What is _Gulp Starter_?

[Gulp Starter](https://github.com/sonangrai/gulpStarter) is the twig templating starter pack. It consist of some pre configured gulpjs setting for creating an HTML templates with twig. It was always geting an extra burden of work when I need to start my templating works. So, I planned to create this repo which will consist of all the basic files pre configured. This lets me just clone this repo and start templating ðŸ˜‰.

```

To begin first install the npm dependencies

```
npm install
```

To run the engine. It will create the build folder with all the HTML files.

```
npm run serve

```

It is configured with the following.
